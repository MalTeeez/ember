# Ember — Decisions

This file lists choices where [requirements.md](requirements.md) is silent, and the reason for each.
Rule: when the spec is silent, choose the simplest option.

## Build and structure

| # | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | Plain Win32 via P/Invoke. No WinForms. | Lower RAM. The project targets `net10.0` (not `net10.0-windows`), so it compiles on Linux without the Windows Desktop targeting pack. |
| B2 | Three projects: `src/Ember` (app, Win32), `src/Ember.Core` (pure logic, no Windows APIs), `tests/Ember.Tests` (xUnit, references Core only). | Tests run on Linux without the app or LibreHardwareMonitorLib. |
| B3 | `EnableWindowsTargeting` is not set. | It is only necessary for `-windows` target frameworks. With it, restore also needs the Windows Desktop reference pack. |
| B4 | Publish = self-contained, single file, not trimmed, not compressed. | "One executable" that runs without an installed .NET runtime. No trimming because LibreHardwareMonitorLib uses reflection (WMI). No compression because it increases RAM at start. |
| B5 | Build property `EmberOffline=true` builds without LibreHardwareMonitorLib (no temperatures). | The development machine had no access to nuget.org. CI builds the full version. |
| B6 | The GitHub Actions workflow was added in the first commit, not at the end. | It was the only way to restore NuGet packages and build/test on Windows during development. |
| B7 | LibreHardwareMonitorLib pinned to 0.9.4. | Repeatable builds. Newer versions can change the kernel driver; test before an update. |
